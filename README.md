A simple basic linear algebra implementation using modern C++.

[![RTD](https://readthedocs.org/projects/esj-bla/badge/?version=latest)](https://esj-bla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


telling the truth: ASC-bla is not really a complete library,
but a starting point for writing your own library, for example as a student's project.
Here are notes on the
[development process](https://jschoeberl.github.io/IntroSC/intro.html)

Run the unit tests in VS Code by installing the "C++ Unit Testing Framework" extension.
Open VS Code in the ASC-bla/test folder and rund the tests using the gui (either in the menu on the left or by manually running individual tests in the file ```unit_tests.h```). Feel free to add your own tests.
